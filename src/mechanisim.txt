ANIMATION MECHANISIM

*home page animation*
-the body has a night style background 
-when the home comp. mount home's animation start--> two more animations depend on home animation: 1. the header --> animation start after 7s . 2.navbar comp. --> start when home animation finished

**using context*
when we change the router from "/showApp" or "/smallApp" to "/" the home comp. make rerender and the home animation start over.
in order to combat that we use context in the MainNav componenet
